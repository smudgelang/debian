Description: State machine generation language
 Smudge is a domain specific language for implementing state
 machines. The compiler generates standard C code as well as graphical
 state diagrams. Its output is optimized for use on very limited
 embedded systems, but designed to be used anywhere state machines are
 appropriate.
